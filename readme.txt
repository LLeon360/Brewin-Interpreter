Despite a lot of testing, I haven't been able to come up with a failing test case especially related to function calls to understand why `Correctness | test_lazy_fcall3 (0/1)` fails.
I tried especially testing behavior with some of the more hardcoded functions like the inputs and print, but I couldn't seem to find discrepancies with Barista.
